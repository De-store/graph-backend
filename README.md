# DeStore

*Decentralize app listing platform.*

## About

This repository is the basic Graph project which is used to query data from the blockchain using smart contract events.

**The Graph** helps us to query the data on the blockchain using events hence giving structure to somewhat unstructured data.<br> By querying the blockchain data, not only helps in faster and efficient results it also helps the developers to completely focus on the `smart contract` logic without worrying about fetching the data.

This project is used to query all the applications which are/will be published on **DeStore**.  

## Other Modules

### Website - dApp

A completely decentralized website which will be used by developers to publish and manage their applications and helps users to get the *DeStore mobile app*.<br>[This](https://github.com/De-store/frontend) is the repository that contains the website codebase<br>`https://github.com/De-store/frontend`

### Mobile app

DeStore also has a mobile application that will help users to view all the listed apps and install them on their devices.<br>[This](https://github.com/De-store/mobile-app) is the repository that contains the mobile app codebase.<br>`https://github.com/De-store/mobile-app`
