# DeStore

*Decentralize app listing platform.*

## About

This repository is the basic Graph project which is used to query data from the blockchain using smart contract events.

**The Graph** helps us to query the data on the blockchain using events hence giving structure to somewhat unstructured data.<br> By querying the blockchain data, not only helps in faster and efficient results it also helps the developers to completely focus on the `smart contract` logic without worrying about fetching the data.

This project is used to query all the applications which are/will be published on **DeStore**.  

## Other Modules

### Website - dApp
